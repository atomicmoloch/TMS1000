PROGRAM START:
0 - 15 : 0 CLO: Clears output registers
1 - 15 : 1 CLA: Clears accumulator (sets to 0)
2 - 15 : 3 LDX 3: Loads 3 in x register
3 - 15 : 7 TCY 15: Loads 15 in y register - this functions by sending a constant to adder P-input using the CKI multiplexxor, then diverting the accumulator output to Y (AUTY)
4 - 15 : 15 RSTR: Zeroes R outputs
5 - 15 : 31 TAM: Transfer accumulator to memory location
6 - 15 : 63 DYN: Y register decremented, 1 to status if no carry. This sends Y to the P-input using the CKI multiplexxor, 15 to the adder N-input, sends the carry to status, and the adder result to the Y register
7 - 15 : 62 BR 15 (4): Branches to 15 (4)
-- Loop will continue until Y is decremented to 0
-- Every iteration will load the accumulator register's value (0) into RAM location 3:Y. As the TMS1000 doesn't guarentee that the RAM will be cleared at power-on, this block of code seems to be present to ensure that
