PROGRAM START:
0 - 15 : 0 CLO: Clears output registers
1 - 15 : 1 CLA: Clears accumulator (sets to 0)
2 - 15 : 3 LDX 3: Loads 3 in x register
3 - 15 : 7 TCY 15: Loads 15 in y register - this functions by sending a constant to adder P-input using the CKI multiplexxor, then diverting the accumulator output to Y (AUTY)
4 - 15 : 15 RSTR: Zeroes R outputs
5 - 15 : 31 TAM: Transfer accumulator to memory location
6 - 15 : 63 DYN: Y register decremented, 1 to status if no carry. This sends Y to the P-input using the CKI multiplexxor, 15 to the adder N-input, sends the carry to status, and the adder result to the Y register
7 - 15 : 62 BR 15 (4): Branches to 15 (4)
-- Loop will continue until Y is decremented to 0
-- Every iteration will load the accumulator register's value (0) into RAM location 3:Y (from 3:15 to 3:0). As the TMS1000 doesn't guarentee that the RAM will be cleared at power-on, this block of code seems to be present to ensure that.
8 - 15 : 61 TCY 0: Loads 0 into y register
9 - 15 : 59 LDP 13: loads 13 into page buffer register
10 - 15 : 55 BR 20 (60): sets page address to page buffer value (13), sets program counter to 20
60 - 13 : 20 LDX 2: Loads 2 into x register
61 - 13 : 40 TCMIY 0
62 - 13 : 16 LDP 0
63 - 13 : 32 BR 0 (0)
